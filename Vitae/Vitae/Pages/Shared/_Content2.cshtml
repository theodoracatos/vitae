        These recommendations do not constitute a complete list of good practices regarding online security. In general terms, a computer is well protected when it works behind a firewall and is equipped with antimalware software such as antivirus and antispyware. It is recommended to regularly update your antimalware software as well as the operating system of your computer. The letters "https" at the beginning of an electronic address and the pictogram in a form of a closed padlock indicate a secure website. A click on the closed padlock gives access to the website certificate and details concerning its validity (it shall contain the holder's ID, the issuer's ID and the expiration date).
