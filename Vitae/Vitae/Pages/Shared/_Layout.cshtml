                These recommendations do not constitute a complete list of good practices regarding online security. In general terms, a computer is well protected when it works behind a firewall and is equipped with antimalware software such as antivirus and antispyware. It is recommended to regularly update your antimalware software as well as the operating system of your computer. The letters "https" at the beginning of an electronic address and the pictogram in a form of a closed padlock indicate a secure website. A click on the closed padlock gives access to the website certificate and details concerning its validity (it shall contain the holder's ID, the issuer's ID and the expiration date).
                <label class="lato-bold d-block mt-4">Specific rules for the use of the Quilvest (Switzerland) Ltd. (hereinafter "QVS") e-banking website</label>
                Do not follow a link with an electronic address (URL) inside an email in order to log in QVS e-banking service. Type in the URL or save it in your Favorites. Do not communicate your personal data (contract number, QR code, etc.) to anyone in any manner, and never by email. QVS does not contact its clients by a non-secured email or by telephone in order to ask for their contract number or QR code to their e-banking page. Do not save any sensitive data (contract number, QR code, etc.) on your computer. Log off your e-banking page after usage and close all the windows of your internet browser at the end of each session. This prevents anyone having access to your computer from using your account. Do not access your banking account from a public computer (cybercafé or free-service computer) or on public Wi-Fi network. Check if the certificate is issued in the name of 'ebanking.quilvest.com' and verified by 'SwissSign EV Gold CA 2014 - G22' by clicking on the padlock displayed in the browser.
